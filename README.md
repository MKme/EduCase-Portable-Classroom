The EduCase is a fully functional classroom inside a portable case. 
It contains fully functional computers (Raspberry Pi) loaded with content, tuorials, tools 
and information which educators can use in any area of the world.

The project is fully self contained and self-powered and also includes provisions for communication 
with the outside world using either cellular data or a dedicated portable satellite dish and receiver 
linked to the Outernet. 

The case houses it's own LCD display but also utilizes an LED projector enabling the entire 
classroom to take part in any content.
